<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. 
    And while this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home.</p>
<p>In fact, chicken Parmesan is one of those meals that's often best made in your own kitchen. The main problem 
    I have with most versions of Chicken Parmesan served in restaurants is that they drown the chicken in so much 
    sauce and cheese that it ends up being a big soggy clump of chicken and cheese. But it doesn't have to be that 
    way, not with this method.
